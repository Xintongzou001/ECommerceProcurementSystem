            This project involves designing a static prototype

        <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of this project is to establish a
            foundational blueprint for an interactive e-commerce
            solution that supports business scalability and
            performance monitoring. By mapping out critical
            relationships and workflows, the prototype aims
            to prepare the system for seamless integration with
            APIs and real-time data processing.
            This enables efficient management of customer interactions,
            accurate tracking of order activity, and insightful
            product-level analytics, all of which are vital for
            data-driven decision-making and enhanced user experience
            in a live commercial environment.
